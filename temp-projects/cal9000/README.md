Cal9000 is a very old OWASP project which last had a release in 2006.

The project page can be found at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_CAL9000_Project

If you want a tool which does encoding and decoding in many formats, I'd strongly suggest you give EnDe a look.  Ther project site is at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_EnDe
