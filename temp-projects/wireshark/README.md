Wireshark is a network traffic analyzer, or "sniffer", for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. A sniffer is a tool used to capture packets off the wire. Wireshark decodes numerous protocols (too many to list).

The current packge for OWASP WTE is a meta-package which relies on the wireshark provided by the Linux distro where this OWASP WTE package is installed.
