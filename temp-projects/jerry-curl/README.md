jerry-curl is a wrapper for the curl command which adds options from a configuration file and the command line allowing for short repeated curl calls.

Basically, it helps put your long curl commands on a diet.

The result of a jerry-curl command is a union of what is in the configuration file and the command-line options you add to jerry-curl. Of the command-line options, those meant for jerry-curl are processed and those meant for curl are passed through to curl.
