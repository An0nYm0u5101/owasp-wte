Paros is a Java based HTTP/HTTPS proxy for assessing web application vulnerability. It supports editing/viewing HTTP messages on-the-fly. Other featuers include spiders, client certificate, proxy-chaining, intelligent scanning for XSS and SQL injections etc.

It has not been updated for several years.  Unless you have a compellig reason to use Paros, I'd suggest you use OWASP ZAP instead since it is actively being developed.

The project can be found at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/paros/
